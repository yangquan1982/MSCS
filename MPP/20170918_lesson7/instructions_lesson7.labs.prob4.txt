To avoid code redundancy problem, we use DuckBehavior interface with four default methods (quack,fly,swim,display) which have implementations of normal duck's behavior. Then on one hand, we build MallardDuck class and RedheadDuck class with no methods, which implement the DuckBehavior interface. On the other hand, we also build RubberDuck class and DecoyDuck class implementing the DuckBehavior interface, which have the methods of fly and quack overriden in order to have thier own specific implementations. Therefore, it is able to reduce the amount of code since normal duck class can reuse the implementations of default methods in interface while special duck class can still override these methods on thier own purpose.
