For the part B, the class Employee has the equals method which is not an overriding method because of its argument not in type of Object. This equals method can correctly compare two Employee objects. Thus, the inList method of the class EmployeeInfo gives the right output when removing duplicates. However, when we use the contains method in the class ArrayList to test whether an employee is in the list, it has to call the Object version of equals since no overriding version of equals is provided. Therefore, the result of this solution is incorrect.
