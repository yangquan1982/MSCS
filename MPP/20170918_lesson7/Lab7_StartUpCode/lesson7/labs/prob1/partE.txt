For part E, type A, type B and type C are all interfaces in which A has the method without implementation. B and C both inherit from A with the same signature default method. When the type D is a class without any method, D must override the method or declare it as an abstract method. When the type D is an interface, it must provide a default method or declare the method with the same signature of the method in B and C. Therefore, through the new feature of default method in interface of Java 8, D must have its own version of inherited method.
