Use the try-with-resources construct to rewrite the class OldFileIO, 
which reads a file word_test.txt using pre-Java 8 approach. 

Do the following:
- Include a catch clause to catch the primary IOException if there is one. 
- In your catch clause, loop through and print any suppressed exceptions 
  that may be thrown (as in the slides)
- Notice how the file word_test.txt is accessed in OldFileIO 
  (see FILE_LOCATION constant). Should this be improved? How?
